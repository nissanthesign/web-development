<p>Once upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was
&quot;Ginger and Pickles.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls&mdash;Lucinda and Jane
Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.</p>

<p>The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and
Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.</p>

<p>They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.</p>

<p>In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly
everything&mdash;except a few things that you want in a hurry&mdash;like bootlaces,
hair-pins and mutton chops.</p>

<p>Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow
tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.</p>

<p>The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.</p>

<br /><br /></div>

<p>The shop was also patronized by mice&mdash;only the mice were rather afraid of
Ginger.</p>

<p>Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made
his mouth water.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot bear,&quot; said he, &quot;to see them going out at the door carrying
their little parcels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have the same feeling about rats,&quot; replied Pickles, &quot;but it would
never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha
Twitchit's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, they would go nowhere,&quot; replied Ginger gloomily.</p>

<p>(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not
give credit.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">

alt="Hedgehog" title="" />

<br /><br /></div>

<p>Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.</p>

<p>Now the meaning of &quot;credit&quot; is this&mdash;when a customer buys a bar of soap,
instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it&mdash;she says
she will pay another time.</p>

<p>And Pickles makes a low bow and says, &quot;With pleasure, madam,&quot; and it is
written down in a book.</p>

<p>The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being
afraid of Ginger and Pickles.</p>

<p>But there is no money in what is called the &quot;till.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

alt="The customers came in crowds every day" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially
the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for
as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.</p>

<p>But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/grayp24.png"
alt="Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat
their own goods" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat
their own goods.</p>

<p>Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.</p>

<p>They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/grayp26.png"
alt="Ginger and Pickles look out the door" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable
to buy a dog licence.</p>

<p>&quot;It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,&quot; said Pickles.</p>

<p>&quot;It is your own fault for being a terrier; <i>I</i> do not require a licence,
and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried
in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;&quot; said Pickles.
&quot;The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9
for bacon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,&quot; replied Ginger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ginger_fig29.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>&quot;And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things&mdash;Where are all the cream
crackers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have eaten them yourself,&quot; replied Ginger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/grayp31.png"
alt="Mice" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.</p>

<p>They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.</p>

<p>&quot;Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an
ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and
four matches?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with comp<sup>ts</sup>,'&quot; replied Ginger.</p>

<br /><br /></div>

<p>After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been
pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an
envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!</p>

<p>Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.</p>

<p>&quot;Bite him, Pickles! bite him!&quot; spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel,
&quot;he's only a German doll!&quot;</p>

<p>The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in
his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.</p>

<p>Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice.
He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ginger_fig37.jpg"
alt="But still the policeman took no notice" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>At length on his last little rush&mdash;Pickles found that the shop was empty.
The policeman had disappeared.</p>

<p>But the envelope remained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><br /></div>

alt="&quot;it is the rates and taxes, &pound;3 19 11-3/4.&quot;" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>&quot;Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid
it is a summons,&quot; said Pickles.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, &quot;it is the rates and
taxes, &pound;3 19 11-3/4.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the last straw,&quot; said Pickles, &quot;let us close the shop.&quot;</p>

<p>They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the
neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/grayp41.png"
alt="Ginger and Pickles" title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues;
he looks stout and comfortable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

alt="The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience." title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit
immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued
to refuse to give credit.</p>

<p>Of course there are the tradesmen's carts&mdash;the butcher, the fish-man and
Timothy Baker.</p>

<p>But a person cannot live on &quot;seed wigs&quot; and sponge-cake and
butter-buns&mdash;not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!</p>

<p>After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints
and candles.</p>

<p>But they did not keep &quot;self-fitting sixes&quot;; and it takes five mice to
carry one seven inch candle.</p>

<br /><br /></div>

<p>And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought
back to her with complaints.</p>

<p>And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would
say nothing but &quot;very snug;&quot; which is not the way to carry on a retail
business.</p>

alt="The poster really was most &#39;ticing." title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster
to say that she was going to re-open the shop&mdash;Henny's Opening Sale! Grand
co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!&quot;</p>

<p>The poster really was most 'ticing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ginger_fig58.jpg"
alt="There was a rush upon the opening day." title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with
customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.</p>

<p>Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out
change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/grayp60.png"
alt="There is something to please everybody." title="" />
<br /><br /></div>

<p>And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.</p>

<p>There is something to please everybody.</p>
